        <h2>Our Goals</h2>

        <div class="goal-box">
          <div class="goal-content">
            <h3>Goal #1 – Education</h3>
            <p>
              Education is a fundamental right and a powerful tool for
              empowerment. Yet, millions of girls within our communities are
              still out of school. Ensuring equal access to quality education
              for all girls is essential for building a brighter future.
              Educated women are more likely to participate in the workforce,
              make informed decisions, and contribute to their communities.

          <div class="goal-content">
            <h3>Goal #2 – Healthcare</h3>
            <p>
              Access to healthcare services, including reproductive health, is
              crucial for women’s well-being and autonomy. Addressing health
              disparities and ensuring access to comprehensive healthcare can
              significantly improve the quality of life for women. This includes
              access to maternal healthcare, family planning services, and
              mental health support.

          <div class="goal-content">
            <h3>Goal #3 – Economic Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
              Economic empowerment enables women to achieve financial
              independence and contribute to their communities. Promoting
              women’s participation in the workforce, supporting
              entrepreneurship, and ensuring equal pay for equal work are vital
              steps toward bridging the gender gap in economic opportunities.

        <h2>Our Milestones</h2>

        <p>
          Concerned Ladies Empowerment and Development Forum has made a strong
          impact, especially in Nigeria—covering Abuja, Delta, Lagos, and
          various rural areas. We've conducted free medical tests for elderly
          women, provided food supplies to hundreds of widows and young girls,
          and carried out outreach programs that support women’s basic health
          and welfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the forum has organized hands-on empowerment programs
          that have trained and equipped hundreds of women and girls with
          practical skills. These include tailoring, soap-making, small-scale
          business training, and basic digital literacy. Through generous
          donations from individuals and partners, they’ve also distributed
          startup materials and small grants to help women kickstart their
          businesses and become financially independent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking ahead, the forum plans to grow its network of donors and
          sponsors, so they can reach even more underserved communities. Their
          goal is to empower thousands more through advanced vocational
          training, leadership development, and access to healthcare and
          education. They’re also working toward establishing permanent training
          centers where women can continuously learn and grow.
