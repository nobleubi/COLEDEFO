      <h2>Fulfilling Our Mission</h2>

      <p class="mission-text">
        Over 100 years ago, our founder said, “Save the Children is often told
        that its aims are impossible – that there has always been child
        suffering and there always will be. We know it’s impossible only if we
        make it so. It’s impossible only if we refuse to attempt it.”
      </p>

      <p class="mission-text">
        Through the decades, Save the Children has continued to work to save
        children’s lives, and that’s still what we do today. By supporting Save
        the Children, you're helping save children’s lives, too.

      <h2>We Do Whatever It Takes</h2>

      <p class="extra-text">
        Our pioneering programs address children's unique needs, giving them a
        healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from
        harm. Our work creates lasting change for children, their families and
        communities – ultimately, transforming the future we all share.
      </p>

      <p class="extra-text">
        In the United States, we work in communities across rural America, where
        many children don’t have access to regular meals or high-quality
        education. Bringing decades of expertise to the table, Save the Children
        teams up with local partners to innovate and address the challenges
        families living in poverty face.
      </p>

      <p class="extra-text">
        Through our work across 115 countries around the world, child
        safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do. We’re fierce advocates
        for children’s rights, protecting them from violence, neglect,
        exploitation, abuse and emotional trauma.
      </p>

      <p class="extra-text">
        Last year, Save the Children responded to 121 emergencies in 63
        countries. Some of the most significant of these included earthquakes in
        Syria and Türkiye, ongoing conflict and mass displacement in the
        Democratic Republic of the Congo, wildfires in Hawaii and the crisis in
        Gaza. We saw children facing malnutrition, forced out of school and from
        their homes due to conflict, and far too worried about where their next
        meal or safe place to sleep would come from to dream about their
        futures. But what we also saw—that not everyone does—were glimmers of
        hope. Progress, however incremental, toward the lasting change that will
        help ensure that all children are able to survive, be educated and
        thrive.
      </p>

      <p class="extra-text">
        This work is only made possible by the ongoing generosity of our donors,
        whose valuable support is used in the most cost-effective ways.

        We believe every child deserves a future. We know you believe it, too.

    <p class="why-text">
        Without you, children’s lives and futures will be forever changed by the urgent needs they face right now. 
        And we will have failed a generation of children. But together, we can achieve tremendous results for children. 
        Here's proof:
